# INDIGO CLEARANCE - UNDER PAIN OF TERMINATION

The Toothpaste Disaster has lead to the near-total subsumption of meatweb into varying degrees of the underlying psychogeography of CANALZONE. The consequent psycho-spiritual harm from the incident dealt to Organic Resource Value Units currently exceeds super-max rates, even when adjusted for casualty inflation. The prevalence of various Unofficial Viral Thought Patterns in CANALZONE have increased by an estimated 200%-600% including Strain C (incites communism), Strain S (incites unapproved sociopathy and/or sadistic behaviour among ROY-clearances), Strains M1 and M2 (causes hallucinations and/or delusional behaviour) and Strain R (incites rebellion against authority, derivant of Strain C). Anti-Liquefactionist Thought Terrorism by Sender and Divisionist traitors (possible foreign intervention by CIA/KFP?) has exceeded the local Personality Modification capabilities of the glanded gentry - with significant quantities of badthoughts in CANALZONE breaking off into sub-simplexes led by unfactual Tyrant-Princelings, including atleast one Lambda-Class Thought Terrorist. An estimated 30% of CANALZONE currently lies under direct or semi-direct control of Québecistan/League-Solar aligned Admiral-Princelings, 40% are controlled by sub-simplexes of varying allegiance/strength/communism, 25% are currently no-bugs-land either due to an unfilled power vacuum or deep submergment of the Torment Complex into the psychogeography, and a remaining 5% are directly controlled by foreign entities (Kraut Hypnorepublik, Eagleland™, Wizard Federation, et. cetera) for economic or hypnoeconomic purposes.

## INCONCLUSIVE LIST OF PROBABLE COMMUNIST MUTANT TRAITORS & HIGHLY-PREVALENT UNOFFICIAL VIRAL THOUGHT PATTERNS

### the Most Serene Coalition Provisional Authority

*We lost the hedge war because we only knew how to fight an ice war. We're losing the canal war because we only know how to fight a hedge war.*

- A collaboration government set up by the United Corporate Liquidation Forces and formally sponsored by The Hamburger Store and the BHCU[^1] for the purposes of establishing a civil, responsible and democratic administration for the extraction of meat, plastic, semen and petrol.
- Supply routes south of the border lead back to Eagleland™ in SANDZONE - rumours[^2] suggest President Billbushmagog himhimself has put great trust and understanding in the very special forces involved with Operation Great Job!, but even if they make a few mistakes, hehe’ll still be very, very proud of them.
- Despite damage to the local psychogeography, it remains extremely hostile to Divisionist thought-concepts, so Historical Battle Re-enactment, History Purification Tactics and extensive use of the VBS Network's prolefeeds are required to ensure the psychogeography does not boil and drown them.

### the Water Control Board

    controls the largest single purified water treatment center in the Torment Complex

    Nominally neutral - but with close ties to the Most Serene CPA due to current financial and hypnofinancial incentives.

### the Vatican Petrostate

*I heard they elected a barge-dweller as the new hydropope.... Yeah... he's from one of 'those' canals.*

### Saltwater Identarian Front

*Saltwater Identarian Front set up a bunch of monofilament wires ahead of our boats. My buddy was on the leading barge, got sliced into a thousand layers before he even saw the light glance off them. Paddlewheel churned up green foam*

### the Pontoon Insurgency

    algae-eater, cursed to wipe clean the pikes of the portcullis at Gate 3 forevermore

### Moloch

    The military artificial intelligence - has control over a net of old military facilities, automated factories, power plants and the like

### the Neojungle

    mass of semi-intelligent carnivorous vegetation that grows faster than kudzu - advancing north

### QPS Alyaska

     , QPS Scythia, and QPS Bactria
    The LoyalteeStandard™ of the glanded gentry - INDIGO and BLUE clearance bugs - remains at an exceptional 100.00%

    documentaries, info-ganda, advertising and youth programming

    In CANALZONE, sluice gates are strongholds, hydroelectricity is the new oil, the barge-wars never end, fish ladders are sacred and fluid mechanics are the new laws of life and death

## POLICY ADVISEMENT

Axiom 1: 100% of vivisected ROY-clearance bugs are 97-100% meat[^3], and contain no semen or petrol.

Axiom 2: We are experiencing a deficit in meat and surpluses in semen and petrol.

Axiom 3: It is most ethical to prioritize the needs of the many over the needs of the meaty.

### Proposal:

- Re-classify International Food Court as thought-terrorist organization.
- Promote adoption of "Bellyfeel" and "Me-meat" concept among the prole through the VBS Network.
- Replace Toothpasty Supplement #5 with Toothpasty Supplement #6 and revise QwalitieStandards regarding Baseline Dental Health to de-approve all routine/recreational use for clearances GREEN to VIOLET, excluding euthanasia.
- Reroute Invalid Care Providers' clients to Food Vat service firms, and revise the Happiness Patrol's Bill of Pains and Penalties to include "vocational re-assessment as long-term interior food vat decoration".
- Increase production quotas of select FunFoods™ including FunFood™ Soylent Red™, FunFood™ Soylent Orange™ and FunFood™ Soylent Yellow™.
- Eat and enjoy. Eat and enjoy. Eat and enjoy

Given public approval of the Whirlwind Miracle Destiny, which sports the highest-rated Glee Quota out of all currently-executed tyrannies at 24.9 Smiles per Person, it is clear implementation of advanced-nutrition-tactics always reduces the spread of Unofficial Viral Thought Patterns amid psychogeographic trauma[^4]. It is the opinion of the committee that the implementation of our modest proposal should be swift.

[^2]: This rumour has been designated as temporarily non-treasonous.
[^3]: Assuming within the acceptable 3% bodymass microplastic intake limit.
[^4]: No evidence has been found and not consequently destroyed that shows any link between the Whirlwind Miracle Destiny and the recent increase in damage to the Dreamweb.
